# Bejewled
This is for converting 3.3.5 Bejewled to 1.12.1 API.

Credit to Xennma for contributing a number of initial changes to get it started.

This addon is to play Bejewled, it can auto play upon Death, and when you Fly. It's very nice for those periods in the game where you have to wait and has built in achievements.
It also has a means of comparing high scores with other players who have the same Addon.
